# The Art of MD

A workshop sponsored by CCPBioSim for doing style transfer of molecular dynamics images and simulations. Note: this workshop is intended to run from Google colaboratory. As a result, some of the code in the notebooks won't run unless opened in Google Colaboratory. This is easily removed if you want to run on a machine with a GPU however. 

The notebooks in this workshop borrow heavily from the  Google Colaboratory notebook authored by the Lucid team on style transfer. This can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lucid/blob/master/notebooks/differentiable-parameterizations/style_transfer_2d.ipynb).
