# The Art of MD

A workshop sponsored by CCPBioSim for doing style transfer of molecular dynamics images and simulations.

The notebooks in this workshop borrow heavily from the  Google Colaboratory notebook authored by the Lucid team on style transfer. This can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lucid/blob/master/notebooks/differentiable-parameterizations/style_transfer_2d.ipynb).
